                    I am a full-stack software engineer with 7 years professional experience building and maintaining full-stack web applications across finance, 
                    research and SaaS platforms. </p>

                    In my most recent role at Symplectic, I independently led an accessibility audit across our Grant Tracker console, identifying key improvements and 
                    writing documentation that helped shape our internal development standards going forward. 
                    I also took full ownership of upgrading jQuery across multiple of our grant tracker products from v1.12.2 to v3.7.1 â€“ 
                    an effort that involved extensive dependency management, ticket creation and QA coordination. 
                    Throughout my career I have primarily used C#, SQL, Javacript, HTML and CSS, but I am always enthusiastic about any opportunity to learn new skills.
