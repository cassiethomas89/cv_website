# My CV Website

This is an experimental personal website built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app) and deployed via [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). It serves as an interactive CV and portfolio. This is a way for me to practice typscript and react.

## Stack
    - Next.js
    - Tailwind CSS
    - Vercel (for CI/CD and hosting)
